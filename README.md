# product_crawler

The objective of the project is to create a total product catalogue across 4 competitors in the Nutritional Health Care space.

_Ideally_ we would like to compare the following features across the competitors:

- Pack size (weight, volume)
- Pack format (bottle, can, container) 
- Flavours
- Pricing
- Number of products in pack
- Ingredients
- Nutrients
- Use of the product

We could also look at the following:

- Number of products by company for shared category
- Most used ingredients across all categories
- Total different flavours available
- Different disease states these companies set to manage

The competitors we will review will be the following:

- Abbott
- Fresenius
- Nutricia
- Nestle Health Science
- Flavour Creations

The information will be derived from the following sources

## Abbott
